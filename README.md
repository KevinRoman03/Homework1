# Homework1

## Description
This website had a few bugs that were reported by users. I was asked to go review the code and see what the issues were on the html amd css files as well  make it more accessible for users, and other programmers looking throught the code. My solution was to conver the code on html file to semantic html. This will make it easier for people after me to see the code and allows them to have a better, easier time. Whilst working on this website I learned that semantic html is easier to edit and understand. My motivation for these changes are that I get to make it make the usere experience more friendly.
## Installation
When I was requested to help out with the bugs I went to clone the repo where the website was made. After that i proceeded to make my own repo on my local machine and make a new branch. Once i had finished changing the code for the website I then commited my changes, and pushed the changes to the origin main as well as merged the branches. When I was working on it I made sure that I would push my changes with descriptions as to what I had changed with the html.
